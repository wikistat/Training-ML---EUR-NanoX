# Training-ML---EUR-NanoX



#### Abstract
This training course enables the participants to reinforce their theoretical and practical knowledge in order to implement machine learning techniques for data analysis. The main algorithms for prediction (supervised learning) are presented. Each method is first presented and commented on a theoretical level, and then illustrated on numerical experiments run with public datasets using R and/or  python/scikit-learn software.

#### Objective of the training
To present the main algorithms for supervised learning : linear models for regression and classification, Classification and Regression Tress, Random Forests, introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning and to use them with R and/or python/scikit-learn.


#### Target participants
This training session is for researchers, students, engineers who wish to reinforce or extend their theoretical background and practical knowledge on automatic data analysis by learning algorithms.

#### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge in statistics: elementary probability and statistics. 
- Basic knowledge in algorithmic and programming.
- **Install** Python 3.6 with [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html). 
- **Install** with `conda` the [Keras](https://keras.io/) library including [TensorFLow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).
- **Install** [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/) and [IR kernel](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/) 
- Internet access during the sessions in order to get possible updates or to load additional libraries.
